uTorrent.py and associated modules/tools were developed with:

    * Windows XP Professional SP2
	* Python 2.5 (r25:51908, Sep 19 2006, 09:52:17) [MSC v.1310 32 bit
	  (Intel)] on win3
	* simplejson Python module (included)
	* µTorrent 1.6.1 BETA (build 483) w/ WebUI v0.310b2
	
*CAVEATS*:

	* When you run uTorrent.py or associated files, you must be *in*
	  their directory. (The logger doesn't like it otherwise.)
	  
	* This should be self-explanatory but the WebUI has to be
	  enabled.

**THERE IS NO DOCUMENTATION AT THIS TIME.** 

(beyond source code and a few scattered comments)

For starters, try running u2til.py -h

That's all, good luck, much uTorrentness to you!
